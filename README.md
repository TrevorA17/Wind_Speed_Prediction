# Wind Speed Prediction
This project aims to predict wind speed based on various weather variables using machine learning models. The dataset includes factors such as temperature (maximum and minimum), rainfall, and other weather-related variables. After data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, we trained and evaluated several machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM). The performance of the models was assessed using key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared, with the GBM model showing the best performance. To make the predictions accessible, a Plumber API was developed, allowing users to input weather data and receive wind speed predictions in real-time. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning to weather forecasting, providing a predictive tool for wind speed based on historical weather data.
